# Laravel UIKit Starter

This application is a boilerplate for the package [Laravel UIKit](https://github.com/sowrensen/laravel-uikit). Explicitly installed packages are:

- Laravel Fortify
- Laravel UIKit

Fortify is configured to work with Laravel UIKit views and layout. The resources of **Laravel UIKit** are not published, leaving the opportunity to configure from scratch.
